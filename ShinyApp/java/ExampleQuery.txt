A little better example -- show count of distinct patients with
any form of Mental Disorder (according to subsumed codes in SNOMED
by ISA relationships).

with snomedct.code_subsumes_codes('74732009') as codes
match (p:Participant)-[:P_SCT]->(pn:ObjectConcept) where pn.sctid in codes
with distinct(p) as affected_pats
return count(affected_pats)
