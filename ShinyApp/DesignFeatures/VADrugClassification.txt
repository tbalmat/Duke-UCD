From Jay Pedersen

Hi,

re: <<Jay and Scott – A couple of questions came up about how to organize the RxNorm medication codes. Not urgent, but I wonder whether you are using SNOMED or ACT or another drug classification/ ontology to group them..?>>

At the moment, we are using the 'VA Drug Classification' to categorize RxNORM-coded drugs (and NDC-coded drug packages).  We get these from a REST API interface from the NLM.  I can give more detailed in formation on that as needed.  We can probably incorporate that into the graph.

The VA drug classification is not a complete classification as there are a significant number of RXCUI-coded drugs that are not included in any of the classifications.  But it does cover a wide range of drugs.

DETAILS

Here are a list of the class names:

Great call yesterday.  For those that missed, the Webex recording is here: Play recording
 
Also, I am attaching some great notes from Sigfried, which also includes some of his suggestions for the interface.
 
Bob and Rima – please see the attached recording and lets also schedule a time for the full group to meet and hear your reaction and suggestion.  Because of Duke Spring Break, we will make this meeting after March 17.  I will start sending meeting requests and see what works for most.
 
Jay and Scott – A couple of questions came up about how to organize the RxNorm medication codes. Not urgent, but I wonder whether you are using SNOMED or ACT or another drug classification/ ontology to group them..?
 
 
Next steps:
1.) Rachel will set a group call for March 17-20.  
 2.) Tom will work toward a public url or other means for Sigfried to see the R app, data, and code.
3.) Think about additional meetings with clinical experts (UCD) and between Sigfried and Prajwal to advance the design.
4.) Direct suggestions, needs, concerns to Rachel 
 
Thanks!
Rachel
