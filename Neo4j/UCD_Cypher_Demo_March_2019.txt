CYPHER queries we worked with today: obtaining frequency counts of behavioral and neurologic disorders
for two sets up patients -- (A) patients with proximal disorders and HASxDX attribute of "HA events at Diagnosis",
and (B) patients with proximal disorders and HASxDX attribute that is NOT equal to "HA events at Diagnosis"

#1. Create set A which are participants with proximal disorders with a HASxDX attribute
    with value "HA events at Diagnosis".  This is a set of 155 participants in the UNMC DB.

MATCH (a:Participant) where (a.UCDDx = 'OTC' or a.UCDDx = 'CPS1' or a.UCDDx='NAGS')  and a.HASxDx='HA events at Diagnosis'
with a
return count(a)

#2. Create set B, which are participants with proximal disorders whose HASxDX attribute
    is NOT "HA events at Diagnosis".  This is a set of 355 participants in the UNMC DB.

MATCH (b:Participant) where (b.UCDDx = 'OTC' or b.UCDDx = 'CPS1' or b.UCDDx='NAGS')  and b.HASxDx<>'HA events at Diagnosis'
with b
return count(b)

#3. Determine frequency counts for Behavioral diagnoses for participants in set A, and separately for set B,
    with no regard for multiple counts from a single participant (that is, all counts from all participants are included
    regardless of whether the same diagnosis is reported multiple times for the same participant).

(3a - set A)

MATCH (a:Participant) where (a.UCDDx = 'OTC' or a.UCDDx = 'CPS1' or a.UCDDx='NAGS')  and a.HASxDx='HA events at Diagnosis'
with a
match (a)-[:P_SCT]->(b:PBehav)-[*..4]->(c:Behav)
return c.FSN, count(c.FSN)

(3b - set B)

Change query 3a slightly ==> a.HASxDx='HA events at Diagnosis' to a.HASxDx<>'HA events at Diagnosis'.
Change variable name 'a' to 'b' if you like (NOTE: I didn't), to make it more clear that set B is being examined.
