Feb 19, 2019 meeting -- CYPHER queries:

-------------- Part 2.   CYPHER queries from this morning: ------------------

NOTE:
(a) P_SCT relationships between Participant nodes and SNOMED CT coded diagnoses
(b) P_RX relationships between Participant nodes and RXCUI coded medications (presumably prescribed and/or administered)

#1. Obtain account of participants whose UCD diagnosis (UCDDX field) is 'OTC' or 'CPS1' or 'NAGS'.

MATCH (a:Participant) where a.UCDDx = 'OTC' or a.UCDDx = 'CPS1' or a.UCDDx='NAGS' return count(a)

#2. Add UCD_Proximal label for participants with any of those 3 UCDDX values.

MATCH (a:Participant) where a.UCDDx = 'OTC' or a.UCDDx = 'CPS1' or a.UCDDx='NAGS'
SET a :UCD_Proximal

#3. Obtain frequency count for participants with various UCDDX values (ignores UCDDX null values)

match (a:Participant)
return a.UCDDx, count(a.UCDDx)
order by count(a.UCDDx) desc

NOTE: that query is very much like the following SQL query (imagine this as a SQL database):

  select UCDDX, count(UCDDX) from UCD_Proximal
  group by UCDDX

#4. Determine count of participants with NULL value for UCDDX.

match (a:Participant) where a.UCDDx is null
return count(a)

#5. Look at the behavior diagnoses for UCD_Proximal participants:

match (a:UCD_Proximal) where a.UCDDx <> 'OTC'
with a
match (a)-[:P_SCT]->(b:PBehav)-[*..4]->(c:Behav)
return a, b, c

#6. Look at behavior diagnoses for all participants who do not have the 'OTC' UCDDX diagnosis code:

match (a:UCD_Proximal) where a.UCDDx <> 'OTC'
with a match (a)-[:P_SCT]->(b:PBehav)-[*..4]->(c:Behav)
return a, b, c

#7. Look at behavior diagnoses for participants with NULL value of UCDDX (different set of participants than #5)

match (a:Participant) where a.UCDDx is NULL
with a
match (a)-[:P_SCT]->(b:PBehav)-[*..4]->(c:Behav)
return a, b, c

#8. Look at the medications prescribed for UCD_Proximal participants

match (a:UCD_Proximal)
with a
match (a)-[r:P_RX]->(b:RXCUI)
return a,r,b

This hung!  Probably needs to be a subset of 'all RXNORM codes',
something like 'anti seizure medications'.
