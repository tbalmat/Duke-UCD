Mark – thanks for lunch and the introduction to Tom.

Tom- 
It was great to meet you last week and thanks so much for your interest in my project.

I will send follow-up information soon. Also, I will meet with our Center for Nursing Research group so I can pass your name on to other researchers here. As I mentioned, we are not too engaged in research with big data sets, but that is changing rapidly.  

More soon. Definitely drop by if you find yourself near the Pearson School of Nursing Building on Trent Drive!

Thanks,
Rachel

Thanks for lunch Mark!

Rachel, it was a pleasure to meet you and I hope that we are able to work together.  Let me know when I am able to take a closer look at the database and SNOMED encoding.  Perhaps, with a good question or two, we can explore the capabilities of neo4j and the particular data you have available.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Really nice lunch. Thanks you both for being such delightful company!
Rachel, I've attached the Holmes Morton article "Through My Window" -- an oldie but a goodie. (And, Tom, you should read it, too.)
Morton, D. H., ‘Through My Window--Remarks at the 125th Year Celebration of Children’s Hospital of Boston’, Pediatrics, 94 (1994), 785–91
Here's Ingrid's brief bio: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingrid_Daubechies. Maybe someday I'll figure out how to work on a project with her.
