Tom and Prajwal – 

Thank you for meeting today. I really enjoyed it and am feeling happy about the potential that you both bring to this project.

One last resource on SNOMED for when you are ready….

Here is some information on the SNOMED CT concept model, and definition of the attributes for different “types” (finding, procedure, body location, etc.) of SNOMED concepts:

I hope you find this interesting…

Have a wonderful holiday and I look forward to talking next year!

Thanks,
Rachel
